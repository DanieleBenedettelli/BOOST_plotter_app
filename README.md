# LEGO BOOST Plotter Wizard
A web app for Chrome to make my LEGO BOOST plotter draw anything

This app is known to work on computers that have Bluetooth Low Energy antennas (BT 4.0 or greater) and run Chrome browser 90.0.4430.93 or later.
The app communicates with the LEGO BOOST hub thanks to @nathankellenicki [node-poweredup library](https://github.com/nathankellenicki/node-poweredup)

The LEGO BOOST plotter building instructions can be obtained at my website:

## known bugs:
- from time to time, the pen goes down and keeps drawing a spurious line until the right edge of the image.
